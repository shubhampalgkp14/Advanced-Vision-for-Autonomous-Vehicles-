Semantic Segmentation for Self-Driving Cars:
This repository showcases the implementation of Semantic Segmentation Model Self-Driving Cars.

Semantic Segmentation:
Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding object class. This detailed understanding of the road scene aids in safe navigation and decision-making.

U-Net Architecture for Semantic Segmentation:-
The U-Net architecture is employed for semantic segmentation due to its effectiveness in capturing spatial information. It features a contracting path for context extraction and an expansive path for accurate segmentation.

Dataset:-
The data set contains sets of RGB and the corresponding semantic segments.
